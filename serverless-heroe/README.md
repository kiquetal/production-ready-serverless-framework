# Serverless-Heroe Course Repository

This repository is used to follow the "serverless-heroe" course offered by Yan Cui. It demonstrates how to create serverless applications using the Serverless Framework v4 with Python running on AWS Lambda and API Gateway.

The current implementation includes a simple HTTP API that lists all S3 buckets in your AWS account, demonstrating basic AWS service integration.

### 2. HTML Endpoint

- **URL**: `/html`
- **Method**: GET
- **Authorization**: AWS IAM
- **Description**: Returns an HTML page from a static file stored in the project.
- **Handler**: `lambdas/handler.returnHtml`

You can deploy the service using the following command:

```
serverless deploy
```

This will deploy using the default stage ('dev') and the default AWS profile.

To specify a different stage or AWS profile, you can use the `--stage` and `--aws-profile` parameters:

```
serverless deploy --stage prod --aws-profile production
```

This will deploy to the 'prod' stage using the 'production' AWS profile.

After deploying, you should see output similar to:

```
Deploying "aws-python-http-api" to stage "dev" (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack aws-python-http-api-dev (85s)

endpoint: GET - https://6ewcye3q4d.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
functions:
  hello: aws-python-http-api-dev-hello (2.3 kB)
```

_Note_: In current form, after deployment, your API is public and can be invoked by anyone. For production deployments, you might want to configure an authorizer. For details on how to do that, refer to [http event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway/).

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can call the created application via HTTP:

```
curl https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
```

Which should result in response similar to the following:

```json
{
  "message": "Go Serverless v4.0! Your function executed successfully!",
  "buckets": ["bucket1", "bucket2", "bucket3"]
}
```

The `buckets` array will contain the names of all S3 buckets in your AWS account.

### Local development

You can invoke your function locally by using the following command:

```
serverless invoke local --function hello
```

You can also specify a stage and profile for local invocation:

```
serverless invoke local --function hello --stage prod --aws-profile production
```

## Project Structure

- `lambdas/`: Contains Lambda function handlers
- `lib/`: Contains shared utility functions
- `static/`: Contains static HTML files served by the application
